Coded this calculator using basic js

description:-
I coded this only by declaring a one single array , using 4 array properties(array.slice,array.join,array.pop,array.push) , if else , while and for loops . The code is beginner friendly although it doesn't follow the DRY rule it is readable by anyone who doesn't know anything about js

The issue:-
Everything works well with the calculator the issue is  if you type more than one operators at a time like if u wanna calculate (1+2-3) it just calculates 1+2 doesn't subtract the result by 3.But the good part is if u do 1+2 then click equals to , it shows 3 and then if u do then if u click on "-" then 3 then click equals to it shows the required result.So it can only operate if the expression has one operator at a time.
